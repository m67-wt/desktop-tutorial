you need to put the cleaned code here. no Css, no confusing divs and paragraphs. just as simple as possible webpage html. <br><br>

if doing javascript script are the variables sensibly named using camelcase "myvar" etc don't use promises (then.) instead use async/await, no addeventlisteners useless necessary, get chatgpt to make the changes. more changes... only simple javascript nothing fancy.

here is the original vibecode<br>
