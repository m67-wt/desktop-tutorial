<h1 align=center>t1a04-vibe-code-cleaning-john.html</h1>

you need to put the cleaned code here. no Css, no confusing divs and paragraphs. just as simple as possible webpage html. <br><br>

if doing javascript script are the variables sensibly named using camelcase "myvar" etc don't use promises (then.) instead use async/await, no addeventlisteners unless necessary, get chatgpt to make the changes. more changes... only simple javascript nothing fancy.

<br><br>

here is the original vibecode<br>
<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="webcam03.html"></iframe>

<br><br>

final comments: any observations about your code compared to the vibecode<br><br>

<textarea id="myComments" rows="4" cols="50">Type your comments here...</textarea><br>
<input type="button" value="show comments" onclick="{
  showComments()
}"><br>
<span id="myOutput">...</span>

<script>
  async function showComments() {
    let myText = document.getElementById('myComments').value
    let myOutput = document.getElementById('myOutput')
    myOutput.innerHTML = 'Your comments: ' + myText
  }
</script>
